# Making presents fairer üéÅ

Santa's elves have reported an issue with gift distribution fairness. Some children are receiving gifts far more
expensive than others in their neighborhood. Santa wants to ensure a more equitable distribution by identifying these
cases. He needs to find all children who received gifts that are more expensive than the average gift price in the North
Pole's gift database, so he can review and adjust the distribution plan accordingly.

### Example Schema

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS children CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS gifts CASCADE;
CREATE TABLE children (
child_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
age INTEGER,
city VARCHAR(100)
);
CREATE TABLE gifts (
gift_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
price DECIMAL(10, 2),
child_id INTEGER REFERENCES children(child_id)
);
```

### Example Data

```sql
INSERT INTO children (name, age, city)
VALUES ('Tommy', 8, 'London'),
('Sarah', 7, 'London'),
('James', 9, 'Paris'),
('Maria', 6, 'Madrid'),
('Lucas', 10, 'Berlin');

INSERT INTO gifts (name, price, child_id)
VALUES ('Robot Dog', 45.99, 1),
('Paint Set', 15.50, 2),
('Gaming Console', 299.99, 3),
('Book Collection', 25.99, 4),
('Chemistry Set', 109.99, 5);
```

### Example solution

```sql
 child_name
|   gift_name    | gift_price 
------------+----------------+------------
 Lucas      | Chemistry Set  |     109.99
 James      | Gaming Console |     299.99
```

### Solution to submit

```sql
Lucas
```

The reason is because the average gift price is 99.492.

## The challenge üéÅ

Write a query that returns the name of each child and the name and price of their gift, but only for children who
received gifts more expensive than the average gift price.
The results should be ordered by the gift price in ascending order.

Give the name of the child with the first gift thats higher than the average.
